This waterfall chart took a lot of effort to show the change from last year to this year. PowerBi limits you to only showing a total instead of showing LY to TY. For privacy issues, I can't show my work exactly but I can show the final screenshot/product. For a reference I used this link to show the concept of creating something like this: https://businessintelligist.com/2020/06/12/power-bi-dax-how-to-make-waterfall-charts-work-showing-starting-and-ending-values/

First you have to create your tables and create a calc with switch functions to pull each row from the tables. By using the switch function you can get a waterfall chart to show TY and LY instead of total. Very nice.
