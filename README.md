This waterfall chart took a lot of effort to show the change from last year to this year. PowerBi limits you to only showing a total instead of showing LY to TY. For privacy issues I can't show my work exactly but I can show some screenshots. For a reference I used this link to show the concept of creating something like this: https://businessintelligist.com/2020/06/12/power-bi-dax-how-to-make-waterfall-charts-work-showing-starting-and-ending-values/

First you have to create your tables and create a calc with switch values to pull each row from the tables. The calc also will have LY and TY in it to show the change. By using the switch function you can get this to show TY and LY instead of total. Very nice.
